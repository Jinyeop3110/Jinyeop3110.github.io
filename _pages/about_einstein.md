Hi, I'm **Jinyeop Song**, a 5th-year PhD student in the MIT Physics Department. My research focuses on understanding the **science of AI**, with a particular emphasis on **large language models (LLMs)**. Over the past few months, I’ve been exploring **scaling laws** and **in-context learning**, uncovering how these models adapt and grow in capability.

Another key interest of mine is building **scalable foundational models for science**. I’m currently involved in projects aimed at developing AI models for **genomics** and **proteins**, helping advance scientific discovery through machine learning.  

I'm always open to discussions and collaborations—feel free to reach out to me!  


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
