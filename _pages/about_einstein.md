Hi, I'm **Jinyeop Song**, a 5th-year PhD student in the MIT Physics Department. My research focuses on understanding the **science of AI**, with a particular emphasis on **large language models (LLMs)**. Over the past few months, I’ve been exploring **scaling laws** and **in-context learning**, uncovering how these models adapt and grow in capability.

Another key interest of mine is building **scalable foundational models for science**. I’m currently involved in projects aimed at developing AI models for **genomics** and **proteins**, helping advance scientific discovery through machine learning.  

I'm always open to discussions and collaborations—feel free to reach out to me!
