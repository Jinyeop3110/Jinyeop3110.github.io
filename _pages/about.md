Hi, I'm **Jinyeop Song**, a 5th-year PhD student in the MIT Physics Department. 

My research focuses on understanding the **Science of AI**, particularly on **large language models (LLMs)**. Over the past few months, I’ve been exploring **Neural Scaling Laws(ICL)** and **In-Context Learning(ICL)**, uncovering how these models adapt and grow in capability.

Another key interest of mine is building **AI for Science**. I’m currently involved in projects developing **Scalable Foundational Models** for multiomics and proteins, helping advance scientific discovery through machine learning.  

I'm always open to discussions and collaborations—feel free to reach out to me!
