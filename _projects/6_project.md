Paper : <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/49023">"Deep-learning-based three-dimensional label-free tracking and analysis of immunological synapses of CAR-T cells"</a>

We propose and experimentally validate a label-free, volumetric, and automated assessment method for IS dynamics using a combinational approach of optical diffraction tomography and deep learning-based segmentation.
